    <!-- ITEM 1 – News Article Review -->
    <section id="news-review" class="milestone-section">
      <h2>Latest Coconut Skincare Insights</h2>

      <p><strong>Article Summary:</strong><br>
        The research article from the <em>Journal of Oleo Science</em> looks at how coconut oil performs as a moisturizer compared to more conventional emollients like mineral oil and standard cream formulas. The authors measured several things: skin hydration before and after application, transepidermal water loss, and how quickly the skin barrier recovered over time. Their results showed that coconut oil noticeably increased hydration, and it also reduced water loss through the skin, which means the barrier was doing a better job at holding in moisture. The paper links this effect to the fatty acids found in coconut oil, especially lauric acid, which can interact with the outer layer of the skin and help it stay flexible and intact. The study also notes that participants generally tolerated coconut oil well and did not report major irritation when it was used in a controlled, cosmetic way. Overall, the authors conclude that coconut oil is not just a trendy natural ingredient, but a legitimate moisturizing option that can perform at a similar level to common commercial products.</p>

      <p><strong>My Response:</strong><br>
        My response to this article is that it makes coconut oil feel much more “real” as a skincare ingredient, not just something people talk about on social media. I live in a place with long, dry winters, so I constantly deal with tight cheeks, flaky makeup, and that uncomfortable feeling after walking home in the cold. Reading that coconut oil can lower water loss through the skin helps explain why it seems to work well when I apply a thin layer at night or mix a little into my lotion. I also like that the study did not hide the comparison to regular moisturizers; it tested coconut oil right beside them and found good results. For my project, this gives me confidence that a coconut-based routine can be both natural and evidence-informed, which is exactly what I want to share with others.</p>

    <!-- ITEM 3 – Picnic Spot Paragraph -->
    <section id="item3" class="milestone-section">
      <h2>My Favourite Picnic Spot in Edmonton</h2>
      <p>
        My favourite picnic spot in Edmonton is <strong>William Hawrelak Park</strong>,
        a big riverside green space with a lake and wide, shady lawns. I like to
        spread a blanket near the water, watch paddle boats drift by, and relax
        under the tall trees. To get there from downtown, drive west along River
        Valley Road, follow Groat Road north, then turn into the park entrance at
        <strong>9330 Groat Road</strong>. Bus routes along Groat Road also stop close
        to the main parking area.
